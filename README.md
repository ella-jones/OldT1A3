## Features

### Add chore
This feature will allow the user to add a chore to their chore schedule. I will allow them to enter the following details about the chore:
* Title of the chore
* Day of the week to complete chore (e.g. putting the bins out could only be done on a Sunday, but other chores might be more flexible).
* Instructions for chore (e.g. if it is cleaning the bathroom, the instructions could be which products to use).
* Approx. time to complete. (e.g. putting the bins out might take 5 minutes, but cleaning the bathroom could take 1 hour.

### Remove chore
This will allow the user to remove any chores from the list that they no longer want there.


### Mark chore as complete
This will allow the user to mark a chore as "completed" or "not completed", so they know what they still have to do for that week.


### View list of chores
This will allow the user to view a list of their current chores and see what they have/haven't completed.


### View chores for a specific day.
This will allow the user to select a specific day of the week and view all chores that need to be completed on that day.

### View non-completed chores
This will allows the user to view all chores that have not been marked as complete, without having to sort through the entire chores list.


### Exit
This will allow the user to exit from the application.

## Implementation Plan
I have used a Trello board to manage my implementation plan. See screenshots below.
